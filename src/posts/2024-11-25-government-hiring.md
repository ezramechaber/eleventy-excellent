> We will have human resources people screen their resumes and look for — and I’m not kidding you — exact matches in the language between the job description and what’s on their résumé.

This conversation between Jennifer Pahlka and Ezra Klein gets at something Democrats/progressives should be as interested in fixing as the DOGE folks: 

Hiring for civil servants in the Federal government is broken. It's trying to solve for the right stuff, but in practice it solves for the ability to copy/paste against the job description.

We can love government, and what an institution *should* do, and demand that it works better.
