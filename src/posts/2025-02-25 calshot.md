I recently built a new tool called Calshots - a simple calendar screenshot generator for sharing project timelines and roadmaps.

Calshots was inspired by a [post from Tom on the Threads team](https://www.threads.net/@ezra/post/DFvH_A0uwwN). The tool lets you quickly create and share calendar views. Add events, customize the look, and export as an image.

Key features include:
* Month view calendar visualization
* Drag & drop event placement
* Quick event creation with customizable details
* Adjustable backgrounds and styling options
* One-click export to PNG
* Copy to clipboard functionality

## Building the Tool

I built Calshots using Cursor and some vibecoding. It's built on Next.js and React. The architecture is fairly straightforward:

```
src/
├── app/                  # Next.js app router
├── components/
│   ├── Calendar.tsx      # Main calendar wrapper
│   ├── CalendarGrid.tsx  # Calendar grid and events
│   ├── EventDialog.tsx   # Event creation/edit modal
│   ├── MonthSelector.tsx # Month navigation
│   └── Toolbar.tsx       # Settings and actions
├── context/
│   └── CalendarContext.tsx # Global state management
├── types/
│   └── index.ts          # TypeScript types
└── utils/
    └── colors.ts         # Color generation utilities
```

The main challenge was creating a drag-and-drop interface that felt natural while maintaining accurate date placement.

I built analytics using PostHog to look at usage/engagement. It was my first time using it and it's... fine. Tracking interactions and new custom events was super straightforward, but the actual UI feels pretty far behind Amplitude at the moment.

## What's Next

There's still plenty to improve! We'll see if I get around to building on this roadmap but it'd look like:

**Design Polish**
* Improving the drag and drop ghost image
* Refining spacing and typography
* Unifying styles for a more polished look
* Enhancing the mobile layout

**Dark Mode**
* Adding a theme toggle
* Creating a dark color palette
* Handling background colors in dark mode
* Persisting theme preferences

**Enhanced Screenshots**
* Refining the export method
* Adding more themes, fonts, and alignment options
* Improving export quality
* Creating additional background styles
