Just spent an afternoon with the current White House Office of Digital Strategy and wow.

The hardest thing in government is doing something new. That's this team's whole job: Meet Americans where they are on the internet, talk to them like normal people. Be on the platforms where people connect, work with creators who have large followings. 

They do all of this at the highest level, under intense scrutiny, for basically no pay.

It's deeply cool to get to the meet the team doing what we did in a new way.
