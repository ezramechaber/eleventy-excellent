How do you run more, better, faster A/B tests?

This isn't for everyone: If you aren't drowning in traffic, if you only have 10 customers, you shouldn't even bother here. That's another conversation.

But if you've got enough traffic that you're running multiple experiments, multiple PMs running experiments, etc. this is worth a read.

[Olga's post in Data Analysis Journal on accelerating A/B testing](https://dataanalysis.substack.com/p/methods-to-accelerate-ab-testing?r=103xc&triedRedirect=true) covers some of the big ways of running experiments faster, including Winsorizing, CUPED, etc.

A bunch of these were new to me.
