title: Masonry
---

Masonry layout is not yet a native part of CSS grid, and currently there is a debate if using `grid-template-rows: masonry;` is actually the best way. I admit, used carefully and without creating confusion with the tabbing order, I kind of like it. In version 3 of the starter I made the masonry layout a web component, and no longer a opt-in feature (was: `masonry: true` in the front matter).

More about that in the [components section](/components/#masonry).
