I lead the core product teams for Bloomberg.com—which you probably know for Matt Levine's [Money Stuff](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/08/business/matt-levine-bloomberg.html)—but is also the world's leading source of business and financial news.

People hire me to:
- Scale product teams
- Start/codify a data and experimentation practice
- Stay customer-obsessed.

I get really, really into the details, and I like the `technical` side of things. Sometimes I'm managing managers, other times I'm rolling up my sleeves as an early-stage IC PM.
