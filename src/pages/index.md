I currently lead the product teams behind Bloomberg.comâ€”which you probably know for Matt Levine's [Money Stuff](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/08/business/matt-levine-bloomberg.html), and the world's leading source of business and financial news.

My superpower is picking up new things extremely quickly. That adaptability has let me play in a ton of different spaces: experimental dev tools startups, unicorn health tech companies, and President Obama's White House.

Across all of them, I've started/scaled experimentation teams, built products users loved, and kicked off growth loops that help us grow exponentially.

I love to build, [even](https://ezramechaber.com/blog/calshotxyz/)/[especially](https://congestionrevenue.nyc) when I'm leading teams.
