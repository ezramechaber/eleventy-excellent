I’m a product leader at Bloomberg.com. I live in Brooklyn with my wife, our son and daughter, and our dog (hi, Dixon).

I lead product management teams behind core product for Bloomberg.com, which you probably know for Matt Levine's Money Stuff, but is also the world's leading source of business and financial news.

People hire me to help them scale their teams, start/codify a data and experimentation practice, and stay customer-obsessed. I get really, really into the details, and I like the technical side of things. Sometimes I'm managing managers, other times I'm rolling up my sleeves as an early-stage IC PM.
